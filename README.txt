How does the program work?

It asks the user to enter the keyword (the word that the user wants to be encrypted) and then asks once again for the key (Playfair cipher uses a key in order to both encrypt and decrypt the text).
After the user has entered both of the words just hit 'Enter' and the program will execute itself, delivering the encrypted text. 
Pretty simple right?

This version of the program can only encrypt programs, future versions will be able to decrypt as well.
